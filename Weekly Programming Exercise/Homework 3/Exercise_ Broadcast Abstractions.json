Some components such as `PerfectLink`,  `Network` and `Timer` are already provided. No need to implement them.\n2. Execute the imports defined below **before** compiling your component implementations.\n3. We recommend making use of the component state and internal messages we have provided, if any, to complete the implementation logic.\n4. You can always print messages to the output log, from within handlers to see what happens during the simulation. e.g. `println(s\"Process $self delivers message $msg\");`\n5. Remember that during the simulation check you can print and observe the simulation time, i.e. with `System.currentTimeMillis()`.\n5. Do not forget to run the checker code block after each component implementation to ensure that all properties are satisfied before exporting and submitting the notebook.\n6.
